#ANALYSIS OF BITCOIN AND ETHERIUM CRYPTOCURRENCY
**ANALYSIS OF BITCOIN AND ETHERIUM CRYPTOCURRENCY**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and with the rise of cryptocurrency types and users in the money market, it is essential for investors to know the state of the market before investing. Using python and some of its libraries like pandas and plotlib as well as data crawled from Yahoo Finance, we are analyzing the Bitcoin and Etherium cryptocurrency market which is important for investors to know the two most valuable coins in terms of market capitalization and the periods at which they were offering most percentage gains over the 5 years.


**OBJECTIVES**
To determine annual performance of the two coins over the 5 years. (2017-2022)
To investigate the performance of the coins during the 2018 market crash.
Investigate the performance of the two coins during the COVID-19 outbreak (2020); give insights as to why the two coins performed in that manner.
Investigate the performance of the two coins, post COVID-19 (2021) and the effect of the monetary policies implemented by the United States Federal Reserve.


**DATA MINING CRITERIA**
Our success criteria will be measured by the following criteria:
We identify the years that had boom (bull markets) and fall (bear markets) periods


**CONSTRAINTS**
We had a challenge in sourcing data related to cybersecurity issues in the blockchain

**DATA UNDERSTANDING OVERVIEW**
In our project, we used two datasets:
A- Bitcoin
B- Etherium
C- Tether
Source of our data is Yahoo finance.
Each dataset has 7 columns.
There are 1567 records in the etherium data set while 1828 is the number of records in the bitcoin dataset.
The datasets were relatively clean with just the ‘close’ column being a bit less useful than the rest of the attributes in the dataset.

**TOOLS USED IN DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT**
For the success of our project, we used the following tools:

Python programing language and some of its library like pandas, and plotlib
Google Collaboratory notebook was used for the testing, analysis and the development of the project codes.
Github where we deploy our project
Jira Kanban for project management and collaboration for efficient working and analysis of the project
A computer with a  ram of 8GB for the first processing of the data
